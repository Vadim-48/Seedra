        <h2 class="one-news__title">When, Where and How to Plant Spinach</h2>
        <p class="one-news__text">Spinach can be either sown directly into the
            garden or started from seeds indoors. For the least work and the
            most convenience, seedlings can also be purchased from a nursery in
            spring.</p>
        <p class="one-news__text">To give spinach a head start, plant seeds in
            sterile seed-starting mix indoors about six weeks before the last
            expected frost date. The seeds will germinate one to two weeks later
            in soil that is between 60 and 68 degrees. If growing in a room that
            stays cool, consider using a seed-starting mat that will raise the
            temperature of the soil.</p>
        <p class="one-news__text">Spinach is frost tolerant, so it can go in the
            ground long before many other crops. When spinach seedlings have two
            true leaves and when there are four or fewer weeks remaining until
            your last frost date, the seedlings may be transplanted
            outdoors. </p>
        <p class="one-news__text">Seeds can be planted outdoors as soon as the soil
            is workable in spring — about six weeks before the last expected
            frost — and they will germinate as the days warm.</p>
        <p class="one-news__text">To germinate seeds faster and more reliably, there
            is a process called “priming.” A week before sowing spinach seeds
            indoors or out, soak seeds in room temperature water overnight or up
            to 24 hours. Next, place the seeds on a paper towel to air dry for
            one or two days. Once the seeds appear dry, place them in an
            airtight container and store the container in a cool place. The
            seeds will have soaked up and retained enough water to stimulate the
            first stages of germination. Wait at least five days, but no more
            than seven, and sow the seeds. </p>
        <p class="one-news__text">Primed spinach seeds will germinate both faster
            and more uniformly: In about five days, the grass-like seedlings
            will emerge. </p>
